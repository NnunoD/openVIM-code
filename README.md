Description: changes made to OpenVIM in order to instantiate VM/servers in ARM processors<br/>
Notes:
- OpenVIM installed on Ubuntu 16.04 (x86_64)
- VM instantiated on Raspberry Pi 3 Model B with openSUSE 42.3 (arm64)
- Images tested: Debian Official Cloud Images for OpenStack (arm64 images, Debian 9.5.0)

Afterwards, changes were made to the image (possible security issues):
- root password changed
- ssh config changed (Permit root login)
