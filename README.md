Description: changes made to OpenVIM in order to instantiate VM/servers in ARM processors<br/>
Notes:<br/>
OpenVIM installed on Ubuntu 16.04 (x86_64)<br/>
VM instantiated on Raspberry Pi 3 Model B with openSUSE 42.3 (arm64)<br/>
Images tested: Debian Official Cloud Images for OpenStack (arm64 images, Debian 9.5.0)<br/>

Afterwards, changes were made to the image:
- root password changed;
- ssh config changed (Permit Root Login);
(Warning: possible security issues due to changes to root)
